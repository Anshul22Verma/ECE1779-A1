start.sh is in the Desktop of the instance. To run like write /home/ubuntu/Desktop/start.sh in Command line.

The project is inside the interactive folder in desktop and the venv is also inside it to activate and host it locally.

/api/upload gen.py does add images to the profile if it exists  but it doesn't return any response.
Whereas /api/register could not be checked becasue of no generator but it will only work for a similar type of generator to upload and not a query form input.

The instance is available in North Virginia and most of the times of logging in the region is Ohio.
